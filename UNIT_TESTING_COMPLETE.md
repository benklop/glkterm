# Unit Testing Setup Complete

## Summary

I've successfully set up a comprehensive unit testing framework for the GLK autosave infrastructure using Unity, a lightweight C testing framework. Here's what was accomplished:

## Testing Framework Setup

### 1. Unity Framework Integration
- Downloaded Unity v2.6.0 framework files (`unity.c`, `unity.h`, `unity_internals.h`)
- Created `tests/` directory with proper CMake configuration
- Integrated with both custom targets (`make check`) and CTest (`ctest`)

### 2. Update Tag System Tests (`test_updatetags.c`)
Created 6 comprehensive tests covering:
- **Deterministic tag generation** - Ensures same objects get same tags across sessions
- **Cross-object type testing** - Windows, streams, and filerefs all work correctly
- **Object lookup functionality** - Find objects by their update tags
- **Null object handling** - Graceful handling of invalid inputs
- **Cross-session consistency** - Rock+type based tags remain stable

### 3. Serialization System Tests (`test_serialization.c`)
Created 7 tests covering:
- **Endian-safe serialization** - Big-endian format for cross-platform compatibility
- **Round-trip data integrity** - Data survives serialize → deserialize cycles
- **Buffer serialization** - Variable-length data with length prefixes
- **Edge cases** - Empty buffers, null pointers
- **Error handling** - Graceful failure on file I/O errors

## Build System Integration

### CMake Configuration
- Added `BUILD_TESTS` option (enabled by default)
- Integrated `tests/` subdirectory into main build
- Created Unity static library target
- Set up proper include paths and dependencies

### Multiple Test Execution Methods
```bash
# Run all tests via custom target
make check

# Run tests via CMake's testing system  
ctest --verbose

# Run individual test suites
make test-updatetags
make test-serialization

# Run tests directly
./tests/test_updatetags
./tests/test_serialization
```

## Test Results

✅ **All tests passing**: 13/13 tests pass consistently
- Update tag tests: 6/6 ✅
- Serialization tests: 7/7 ✅

## Code Quality Improvements

Added safety checks to serialization functions:
- Null pointer validation for file handles
- Null pointer validation for output parameters
- Proper error propagation

## Next Steps

The unit testing framework is now ready to support further development:

1. **Window State Serialization Tests** - As we implement actual GLK window state serialization
2. **Integration Tests** - Full autosave/autorestore cycle testing
3. **Error Recovery Tests** - Corrupted save file handling
4. **Performance Tests** - Large game state serialization timing

The testing infrastructure provides a solid foundation for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the autosave implementation as we continue with Phase 2 of the project.
